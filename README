RethinkDB running from docker

This is currently at the proof of concept level and should not 
be considered anything other than a toy.

This shows how to restart a docker container on its hook invocations
with new cli/env settings.

I'm still seeing intermittent hook failures which are usually 
resolved with juju resovled -r <unitname>

Little time has been spent trying to make this more robust.
